# Multi-GPU Training with PyTorch and TensorFlow

## About

This workshop shows participants how to optimize single-GPU training. The concepts of multi-GPU training are introduced before demonstrating the use of Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) in PyTorch. Other distributed deep learning frameworks will be discussed. While the workshop is largely focused on PyTorch, demonstrations for TensorFlow are available.

## Setup

Make sure you can run the Python script `test.py` on Adroit:

```bash
$ ssh <YourNetID>@adroit.princeton.edu  # VPN required if off-campus
$ git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/multi_gpu_training.git
$ cd multi_gpu_training/test
$ module load anaconda3/2021.5
$ python test.py
Success
```
